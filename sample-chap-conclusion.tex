\section{Introduction}
%In this last chapter, you may outline the success of your project when compared to the objectives that were set. You may suggest further work for your research area.

In the current phase of this project, drivers vehicle operation data is able to be classified to three groups by using the K Means algorithm module provided by the KNIME Analytic Platform. The linear correlation module of KNIME Analytic Platform is used to identify the strength of the relationship among the features before selection. The selected features for clustering contain GPS Altitude, GPS Bearing, GPS Vehicle Speed (km/h), Engine Speed, Throttle Position, and Speed Test.

Vehicle operation data is labeled based on the grouping. Each driver contains good, medium, and bad vehicle condition data. A calculation method has been introduced to determine the risk level of the drivers based on the amount of each type of vehicle condition data.

\section{Conclusion}

After this project phase, driver risk level is able to be determine by using the clustered vehicle operation data.
%A good final year report should summarize the most important findings and conclude. Always make explanations complete. Avoid speculation that cannot be tested in the foreseeable future. Discuss possible reasons for expected or unexpected findings.
