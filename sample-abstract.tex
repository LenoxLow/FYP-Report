This project proposed a driver driving behaviour profiling method based on the vehicle telemetric data and K-Means Algorithm. The proposed method collects the vehicle operational data and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. The vehicle telemetric data includes the vehicle speed, throttle position, engine speed, latitude coordinate, longitude coordinate, GPS speed, and others. The proposed method makes use of the On Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) interface, smartphone GPS device and Torque Lite version Android application to do the data collection. A feature will be added on to the dataset. The value of the feature determines whether current vehicle speed exceeded the speed limit of the road or not. K-Means algorithm will group the records into three clusters and each record will be labelled as good, medium or bad condition data according to the cluster. Based on the number of each condition data the driver had, the driver can be profiled as low risk, medium risk or high risk driver.
