This project proposed a driver driving behavior profiling method based on the on board diagnostic (OBD) information and K Means Algorithm. The proposed method collects the vehicle operational data and GPS data. The vehicle operational data includes the vehicle speed, engine speed, engine coolant temperature, throttle position, latitude coordinate, longitude coordinate, GPS speed, and others. The proposed method makes use of the OBD interface, smartphone GPS device and Torque(Lite) Android application to do the data collection. A feature will be added on to the dataset. The value of the feature determines whether current vehicle speed exceeded the speed limit of the road or not. K Means algorithm will group the records into three clusters and each record will be labeled as good, medium or bad condition data according to the cluster. Based on the number of each condition data the driver had, the driver can be profiled as low risk, medium risk or high risk driver.
