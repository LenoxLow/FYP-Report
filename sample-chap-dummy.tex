\section{Research Methodology and Design}
In this chapter, you can define your research methodlogy and how you studied the problem and what you used – materials, subjects and equipment. Describe on how you performed the research – methods and procedure. 

You can include your pseudocode or algorithm in here.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{MyTestingProcedure}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure {MyTestingProcedure}{$G$,$p$}
\If {$p\geq G$}
\State $p\gets G$
\Else
\If {$p+k\leq G$}
\State $G\gets p+k$
\EndIf
\EndIf
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{equation*}
X = \sum_{i=1}^n (x^2-x)
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
Y = \left[\prod_{i=1}^n (X|x_n) \right]^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation*}
